### Description

During all my career as frontend engineer, I always wanted to realize my personal blog and portfolio: create a place to show my 
projects and to share my thoughts, ideas and hopes. You can imagine that myy very first attempt of building my own portfolio can be traced back in 2019, where I was exploring Static Site Generation in React.

### Nuxt ecosystem

In the last three years as Software Engineer in TUI Musement, I've been using Nuxt as framework in frontend projects, so it was easy to choose where to start my project. Moreover, with the release of <a href="https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-ui-v4" target="_blank">Nuxt UI v4</a>, 
a lot of components that were under payment license have being released open source, so for me this was the occasion for both testing and knowing better this new library version.

At the same time, Nuxt ecosystem comprehends <a href="https://content.nuxt.com/" target="_blank">Nuxt Content</a>, a git-based headless Content Management System (CMS) that works as a module for the Nuxt framework. It enables everyone to build content-driven websites by managing content directly through files in a `content/` directory. In my case, I've identified two different contents:

- **projects**: like the page you're reading right now, it introduces a project made with tech specifications;
- **articles**: a blog article in which I talk about something I've implemented and thoughts, reasoning and ideas that led me to some directions.
